<h1 align="center"> <p>TJNU Datasets</p></h1>

The TJNU Datasets consist of large-scale TLS and UAV photogrammetric point clouds. The datasets are used for benchmarking automatic registration methods for homogeneous and heterogeneous point clouds. Three datasets were acquired in the campus of the Tianjin Normal University (TJNU), China. The scan stations are shown below.
